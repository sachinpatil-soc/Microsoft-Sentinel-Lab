# Microsoft Sentinel SOC Investigation Lab

### 🔐 Azure Honeypot | Security Monitoring | Threat Hunting | Incident Investigation | Microsoft Sentinel

This project simulates a real-world Tier 1 Security Operations Center (SOC) investigation by monitoring, analyzing, documenting, and responding to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute-force attacks using Microsoft Sentinel.

The objective extends beyond log collection. It follows the complete SOC investigation lifecycle—from security monitoring and alert triage to threat hunting, incident documentation, and playbook-driven response—reflecting workflows commonly used in enterprise Security Operations Centers.

 # 🏢 Business Problem & 🛠️ Project Objectives

## 🏢 Business Problem

Organizations frequently expose Windows servers to the Internet for remote administration. These Internet-facing systems are common targets for automated password spraying and brute-force attacks.

Without centralized monitoring, analysts may fail to identify suspicious authentication activity quickly, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

This project demonstrates how Microsoft Sentinel can be used to detect, investigate, prioritize, and document these attacks before they become successful compromises.

## 🛠️ Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to simulate the day-to-day operational responsibilities of a Tier 1 SOC Analyst by executing a structured, end-to-end incident investigation workflow:

1. ☁️ Deploy a Windows Honeypot in Microsoft Azure
2. 📥 Collect real-world attacker telemetry
3. 🖥️ Monitor security events using Microsoft Sentinel
4. 🔍 Investigate brute-force attacks using Kusto Query Language (KQL)
5. 👹 Identify attacker behavior and attack patterns
6. 📄 Document the incident investigation
7. 🛡️ Execute a Tier 1 Incident Response Playbook
8. 🚨 Demonstrate the Incident Escalation process from Tier 1 to Tier 2
9. 📊 Perform proactive threat hunting using KQL.
10. ✅ Simulate an enterprise SOC investigation workflow

# 🛡️ SOC Responsibilities Demonstrated

## 🖥️ Security Monitoring

- 👁️ Continuously monitored Windows Security Events using Microsoft Sentinel.
- 📥 Collected authentication logs from an exposed Azure Virtual Machine.

## 🚨 Alert Triage

Investigated repeated failed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) authentication attempts.

Performed initial triage by analysing:

- 🌐 Source IP Address
- 👤 Username targeted
- 🔢 Failed Login Count
- ⏰ Time of Activity
- 🌍 Geographic Origin



## 🔍 Incident Investigation

Performed investigation of:

- 🆔 Event ID 4625 (Failed Logon)
- 📊 Login frequency
- 🔨 Brute-force attack behaviour
- 🏳️ Source countries
- 🛑 Suspicious IP addresses



## 🏹 Threat Hunting

Developed KQL queries to identify:

- 🔝 Top attacking IP addresses
- 🎯 Most targeted usernames
- 🗺️ Login attempts by country
- ⚡ High frequency authentication failures


## 📄 Incident Documentation

Documented findings using a structured investigation report including:

- 📝 Detection Summary
- 🏷️ Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- 🧠 Analysis
- ⚠️ Risk Assessment
- 🛠️ Recommended Mitigation


## ⚡ Escalation Decision

Established escalation criteria for potential credential compromise based on:

- 📈 Excessive authentication failures
- 🔑 Successful login after repeated failures
- 👥 Multiple usernames targeted from one IP
- 🚩 High-risk geographic source
